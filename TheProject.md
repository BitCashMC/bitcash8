# The Project
A long term project that I will continousely update and build from the ground up. It is built so that its general purposed and can allow me to apply various domains of expertise.

### Project Objective
You must create an **application** that initially starts with a login page. The login page requires a username and a password (to eventually be YAML-based, but for now simply hardcoded). Afterwards, you should
be able to open a central GUI menu that allows you to access various services including:
 - **Calculator**
 - **Book Reader (Using some form of IO channel)**
 - *The rest to be determined after*

#### Login Page
A login page that requires a username and password, as well as a question mark button that gives information on what to do if you forgot your password.
Should contain a nice picture with a nice border and a description of the application.

 - Add login button

 - Add the change image setting.

#### Home Menu
A menu serving as a launch pad to various services

#### Calculator
